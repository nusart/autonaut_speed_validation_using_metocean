This work aims to validate and improve the speed-over-ground(SOG) model for an Unmanned Surface Vehicle(USV) known as AutoNaut using non-linear Gaussian Process Regressor(GPR). The non-linear GPR model is trained with SOG measurements from a GNSS unit and metocean data from Copernicus Marine Services. 

This work is supported by iFADO project funded with ERDF funds from the INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme by JUNO - Robotic exploration of Atlantic waters.
